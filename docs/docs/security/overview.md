# Security Overview

Your traffic stays private even when it passes through transit nodes you don't control. Only the ingress and exit see your data - everything in between sees encrypted bytes they cannot decrypt.

**What this means for you:**
- Compromise a transit node? They see nothing useful
- Network tapped between agents? Traffic is encrypted
- Unauthorized client tries to connect? Rejected by authentication

## Security Model

### End-to-End Encryption

Transit nodes relay your traffic without being able to read it:

- Your data is encrypted before leaving the ingress
- Only the exit node can decrypt it
- Even if a transit is compromised, your data stays private

See [End-to-End Encryption](/security/e2e-encryption) for details.

### Transport Security

All peer connections use TLS 1.3:

- **Encryption**: All traffic encrypted in transit
- **Authentication**: Server certificates validated
- **Mutual TLS**: Optional client certificate authentication
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Session keys derived per connection

### Authentication Layers

| Layer | Mechanism | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| E2E | X25519 + ChaCha20-Poly1305 | Stream data encryption |
| TLS | Certificates | Peer authentication |
| mTLS | Client certs | Mutual authentication |
| SOCKS5 | Username/password | Client authentication |
| Shell | bcrypt password | Command authorization |
| File Transfer | bcrypt password | Transfer authorization |
| Sleep/Wake | Ed25519 signatures | Command authentication |

### Authorization

- **Route-based ACL**: Exit only allows configured CIDRs
- **Shell whitelist**: Only whitelisted commands allowed
- **File path restrictions**: Only allowed paths accessible

## What You're Protected Against

| If This Happens... | You're Protected Because... |
|--------------------|----------------------------|
| Someone captures traffic between agents | It's encrypted - they see random bytes |
| Transit node is compromised | E2E encryption - transit can't decrypt your data |
| Someone replays captured traffic | Nonce-based encryption detects replays |
| Someone modifies traffic in transit | Authenticated encryption detects tampering |
| Unauthorized peer tries to connect | mTLS rejects unknown certificates |
| Unauthorized client tries to use proxy | SOCKS5 authentication blocks them |
| Someone tries to run unauthorized commands | Shell whitelist blocks unapproved commands |
| Someone tries to hibernate your mesh | Signing keys verify sleep/wake commands |

## What You Need to Protect Yourself

| Risk | Your Responsibility |
|------|---------------------|
| CA private key stolen | Store it securely (HSM, vault, encrypted disk) |
| Ingress or exit host compromised | Harden your endpoints - they see your data |
| Traffic pattern analysis | Disable protocol identifiers, use standard ports. See [Traffic Patterns](/security/traffic-patterns) |
| Insider with valid credentials | Monitor logs, rotate credentials |

## Security Checklist

### Minimum Security

- [ ] TLS certificates generated and deployed
- [ ] Certificate CA key secured
- [ ] SOCKS5 bound to localhost or authenticated
- [ ] Exit routes restricted to needed CIDRs

### Recommended Security

- [ ] Mutual TLS enabled
- [ ] SOCKS5 authentication enabled
- [ ] Shell disabled or password-protected
- [ ] File transfer disabled or restricted
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured
- [ ] Regular certificate rotation

### Production Security

- [ ] All of the above
- [ ] CA key in HSM or secure vault
- [ ] Network segmentation
- [ ] Intrusion detection
- [ ] Audit logging
- [ ] Incident response plan

## Quick Hardening

Apply these four changes for immediate security improvement:

1. **Disable unused features** - Shell and file transfer are disabled by default. Keep them disabled unless needed. See [Shell](/configuration/shell) and [File Transfer](/configuration/file-transfer) configuration.

2. **Restrict SOCKS5 access** - Bind to localhost and enable authentication. See [SOCKS5 Configuration](/configuration/socks5).

3. **Restrict exit routes** - Only advertise specific CIDRs, not `0.0.0.0/0`. See [Exit Configuration](/configuration/exit).

4. **Enable mTLS** - Require valid client certificates for peer connections. See [TLS Configuration](/configuration/tls-certificates).

For detailed hardening guidance, see [Best Practices](/security/best-practices).

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. Do NOT open a public issue
2. Contact the maintainers privately
3. Provide detailed reproduction steps
4. Allow reasonable time for fix before disclosure
