# TLS Certificate Configuration

All peer connections in Muti Metroo use TLS for encryption and authentication. This guide covers certificate generation and configuration.

## Overview

Muti Metroo uses a PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) model with centralized TLS configuration:

1. **Certificate Authority (CA)**: Signs all certificates, configured once globally
2. **Agent Certificate**: Used for both server and client authentication
3. **Global mTLS Setting**: Enable/disable mutual TLS with a simple boolean

## Global TLS Configuration

TLS settings are configured once in the global `tls:` section:

```yaml
tls:
  # CA certificate for verifying peers and clients
  ca: "./certs/ca.crt"

  # Agent's identity certificate (used by listeners and peer connections)
  cert: "./certs/agent.crt"
  key: "./certs/agent.key"

  # Enable mutual TLS on listeners (require client certificates)
  mtls: true
```

This single configuration is used by:
- All listeners (for server TLS and optional mTLS)
- All peer connections (for client certificate presentation)

## Certificate Requirements

**Important**: Muti Metroo only accepts EC (Elliptic Curve) certificates. RSA certificates are not supported for the mesh CA and agent certificates.

The only exception is when connecting through a WebSocket proxy to an external server - in this case, the external server may use any certificate type since mTLS is not available through proxies.

## Generating Certificates

### Using the CLI

```bash
# Generate CA (do once, share across mesh)
muti-metroo cert ca --cn "My Mesh CA" -o ./certs

# Generate agent certificate (signed by the CA)
muti-metroo cert agent --cn "agent-1" \
  --ca ./certs/ca.crt \
  --ca-key ./certs/ca.key \
  --dns "agent1.example.com" \
  --ip "192.168.1.10" \
  -o ./certs

# View certificate info
muti-metroo cert info ./certs/agent-1.crt
```

:::tip Default Paths
If you use `-o ./certs` for the CA, the `--ca` and `--ca-key` flags default to `./certs/ca.crt` and `./certs/ca.key`, so you can omit them.
:::

All certificates generated by the CLI use P-256 ECDSA keys.

### Using OpenSSL

```bash
# Generate EC CA key and certificate
openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out ca.key
openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key ca.key -sha256 -days 365 \
  -out ca.crt -subj "/CN=My Mesh CA"

# Generate EC agent key and CSR
openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out agent.key
openssl req -new -key agent.key -out agent.csr \
  -subj "/CN=agent-1"

# Sign agent certificate
openssl x509 -req -in agent.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key \
  -CAcreateserial -out agent.crt -days 365 -sha256
```

## Configuration Options

### File-Based Certificates

Standard approach using file paths:

```yaml
tls:
  ca: "./certs/ca.crt"
  cert: "./certs/agent.crt"
  key: "./certs/agent.key"
  mtls: true
```

### Inline PEM Certificates

Embed certificates directly in config (useful for Kubernetes secrets):

```yaml
tls:
  ca_pem: |
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    MIIBkTCB+wIJAKi...
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
  cert_pem: |
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    MIIBkTCB+wIJAKi...
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
  key_pem: |
    -----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----
    MIIEvQIBADANBg...
    -----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----
  mtls: true
```

Inline PEM takes precedence over file paths.

### Environment Variables

Use environment variables for secrets:

```yaml
tls:
  ca_pem: "${TLS_CA}"
  cert_pem: "${TLS_CERT}"
  key_pem: "${TLS_KEY}"
  mtls: true
```

## Mutual TLS (mTLS)

mTLS requires both sides to present certificates. With the global configuration, enabling mTLS is simple:

```yaml
tls:
  ca: "./certs/ca.crt"
  cert: "./certs/agent.crt"
  key: "./certs/agent.key"
  mtls: true    # Enable mTLS on all listeners
```

When `mtls: true`:
- Listeners require connecting peers to present valid client certificates
- The global CA is used to verify client certificates
- The global agent certificate is automatically used by peers as their client certificate

### Benefits of mTLS

- Mutual authentication (both sides verified)
- Prevents unauthorized connections
- Defense against man-in-the-middle attacks
- Required for zero-trust environments

## Per-Listener Overrides

Individual listeners can override global settings:

```yaml
tls:
  ca: "./certs/ca.crt"
  cert: "./certs/agent.crt"
  key: "./certs/agent.key"
  mtls: true

listeners:
  # Uses global settings
  - transport: quic
    address: "0.0.0.0:4433"

  # Override: disable mTLS for this listener
  - transport: h2
    address: "0.0.0.0:8443"
    tls:
      mtls: false

  # Override: use different certificate
  - transport: ws
    address: "0.0.0.0:443"
    tls:
      cert: "./certs/public-facing.crt"
      key: "./certs/public-facing.key"
      mtls: false

  # No TLS: plaintext for reverse proxy
  - transport: ws
    address: "127.0.0.1:8080"
    plaintext: true
```

## Per-Peer Overrides

Individual peer connections can override global settings:

```yaml
tls:
  ca: "./certs/ca.crt"
  cert: "./certs/agent.crt"
  key: "./certs/agent.key"
  mtls: true

peers:
  # Uses global CA and cert
  - id: "abc123..."
    transport: quic
    address: "192.168.1.50:4433"

  # Override: different CA for this peer
  - id: "def456..."
    transport: quic
    address: "external.example.com:4433"
    tls:
      ca: "./certs/external-ca.crt"

  # Certificate pinning
  - id: "ghi789..."
    transport: quic
    address: "pinned.example.com:4433"
    tls:
      fingerprint: "sha256:ab12cd34..."
```

## Certificate Validity

### Validity Period

Default validity periods:
- CA certificates: **365 days**
- Agent/client certificates: **90 days**

Specify custom validity:

```bash
muti-metroo cert ca --days 730       # 2 years
muti-metroo cert agent --days 180    # 6 months
```

### Subject Alternative Names (SANs)

Always include SANs for agent certificates:

```bash
muti-metroo cert agent --cn "agent-1" \
  --ca ./certs/ca.crt \
  --ca-key ./certs/ca.key \
  --dns "agent1.example.com,agent1.internal" \
  --ip "192.168.1.10,10.0.0.10" \
  -o ./certs
```

## Certificate Rotation

### Planned Rotation

1. Generate new certificates before expiration
2. Deploy new certificates alongside old ones
3. Update configuration to use new certificates
4. Restart agents
5. Remove old certificates

### Emergency Rotation

If CA is compromised:

1. Generate new CA
2. Generate new certificates for all agents
3. Deploy and restart all agents simultaneously
4. Revoke trust in old CA

## Monitoring Expiration

### CLI Check

```bash
muti-metroo cert info ./certs/agent.crt
```

Output includes expiration date.

### OpenSSL Check

```bash
openssl x509 -enddate -noout -in ./certs/agent.crt
```

### Automated Monitoring

Add to your monitoring:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Check if cert expires in next 30 days
openssl x509 -checkend 2592000 -noout -in ./certs/agent.crt
if [ $? -eq 1 ]; then
  echo "Certificate expires soon!"
fi
```

## Troubleshooting

### Certificate Not Trusted

```
Error: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority
```

- Verify CA certificate is correct
- Check CA was used to sign agent certificate

### Certificate Expired

```
Error: x509: certificate has expired
```

- Generate new certificate
- Check system time is correct

### Name Mismatch

```
Error: x509: certificate is valid for agent1.example.com, not agent2.example.com
```

- Use correct hostname/IP
- Add SANs when generating certificate

### Private Key Mismatch

```
Error: tls: private key does not match public key
```

- Verify key matches certificate:
  ```bash
  openssl x509 -noout -pubkey -in agent.crt | openssl md5
  openssl ec -in agent.key -pubout 2>/dev/null | openssl md5
  # Must match
  ```

### RSA Certificate Rejected

```
Error: certificate must use ECDSA, got RSA
```

- Muti Metroo only accepts EC certificates
- Regenerate certificates using ECDSA (P-256)

## Best Practices

1. **Use EC certificates**: RSA is not supported
2. **Protect CA private key**: Use hardware security module or secure vault
3. **Use short validity**: 90-365 days for agent certs
4. **Use SANs**: Include all hostnames and IPs
5. **Enable mTLS**: Especially in production
6. **Automate rotation**: Before certificates expire
7. **Monitor expiration**: Alert before expiry

## Examples

### Development

```yaml
tls:
  ca: "./dev-certs/ca.crt"
  cert: "./dev-certs/agent.crt"
  key: "./dev-certs/agent.key"
  mtls: false    # Relax for development

listeners:
  - transport: quic
    address: "0.0.0.0:4433"
```

### Production with mTLS

```yaml
tls:
  ca: "/etc/muti-metroo/certs/ca.crt"
  cert: "/etc/muti-metroo/certs/agent.crt"
  key: "/etc/muti-metroo/certs/agent.key"
  mtls: true

listeners:
  - transport: quic
    address: "0.0.0.0:4433"

peers:
  - id: "abc123..."
    transport: quic
    address: "peer.example.com:4433"
```

### Kubernetes

```yaml
tls:
  ca_pem: "${CA_CRT}"
  cert_pem: "${TLS_CRT}"
  key_pem: "${TLS_KEY}"
  mtls: true

listeners:
  - transport: quic
    address: "0.0.0.0:4433"
```
