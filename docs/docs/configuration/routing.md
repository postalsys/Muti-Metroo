# Routing Configuration

Control how routes propagate through your mesh. These settings affect route advertisement timing, expiration, and path depth limits.

**Default settings work for most deployments:**
```yaml
routing:
  advertise_interval: 2m
  route_ttl: 5m
  max_hops: 16
```

## Configuration

```yaml
routing:
  advertise_interval: 2m   # How often to re-advertise routes
  node_info_interval: 2m   # How often to advertise node info
  route_ttl: 5m            # How long routes are valid
  max_hops: 16             # Maximum path length
```

## Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `advertise_interval` | duration | `2m` | Route advertisement frequency |
| `node_info_interval` | duration | `2m` | Node info advertisement frequency |
| `route_ttl` | duration | `5m` | Time until routes expire |
| `max_hops` | int | `16` | Maximum route path length |

## Route Advertisement

Routes are periodically re-advertised to keep them alive:

```yaml
routing:
  advertise_interval: 2m  # Re-advertise every 2 minutes
```

### Trigger Immediate Advertisement

After configuration changes, trigger immediate advertisement:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/routes/advertise
```

### Trade-offs

| Interval | Bandwidth | Responsiveness |
|----------|-----------|----------------|
| `30s` | Higher | Fast failover |
| `2m` | Moderate | Good balance |
| `5m` | Lower | Slower failover |

## Route TTL

Routes expire if not refreshed:

```yaml
routing:
  route_ttl: 5m  # Routes expire after 5 minutes
```

### Relationship with Advertisement

TTL should be **at least 2x** the advertisement interval:

| Advertisement | Recommended TTL | Why |
|---------------|-----------------|-----|
| `30s` | `90s` | Allow 2 missed advertisements |
| `2m` | `5m` | Default - good balance |
| `5m` | `12m` | Slower networks |

If TTL < 2x advertisement interval, routes may flap during normal operation.

## Node Info Advertisement

Node info (display name, roles, system info) is advertised separately:

```yaml
routing:
  node_info_interval: 2m  # Update node info every 2 minutes
```

This controls how often the dashboard sees updated information about agents.

## Maximum Hops

Limit route propagation depth:

```yaml
routing:
  max_hops: 16  # Routes stop propagating after 16 hops
```

### What max_hops Affects

- **Route advertisements**: Routes with metric >= max_hops are not forwarded
- **NOT stream paths**: Stream open timeout (30s default) limits actual path length

### Recommended Values

| Topology | Suggested max_hops |
|----------|-------------------|
| Simple chain (2-3 agents) | `4` |
| Small mesh (5-10 agents) | `8` |
| Large mesh (10+ agents) | `16` |
| Complex topology | `16` (default) |

Setting max_hops too low may prevent routes from reaching all agents. Setting it too high has minimal cost.

## Connection Tuning

Related settings in the `connections` section affect peer behavior:

```yaml
connections:
  idle_threshold: 30s      # Keepalive after idle time
  timeout: 90s             # Peer dead after no response
  keepalive_jitter: 0.2    # Timing jitter (OPSEC)

  reconnect:
    initial_delay: 1s      # First reconnect attempt
    max_delay: 60s         # Maximum backoff
    multiplier: 2.0        # Backoff multiplier
    jitter: 0.2            # Reconnect timing jitter
    max_retries: 0         # 0 = infinite retries
```

### Keepalive Settings

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `idle_threshold` | duration | `30s` | Send keepalive after idle |
| `timeout` | duration | `90s` | Declare peer dead |
| `keepalive_jitter` | float | `0.2` | Timing randomization |

### Reconnection Settings

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `initial_delay` | duration | `1s` | First retry delay |
| `max_delay` | duration | `60s` | Maximum retry delay |
| `multiplier` | float | `2.0` | Exponential backoff factor |
| `jitter` | float | `0.2` | Retry timing randomization |
| `max_retries` | int | `0` | Maximum attempts (0 = infinite) |

## Tuning Guide

### Fast Failover

For environments requiring quick recovery:

```yaml
routing:
  advertise_interval: 30s
  route_ttl: 90s

connections:
  idle_threshold: 15s
  timeout: 45s
```

### Bandwidth Conscious

For low-bandwidth or metered connections:

```yaml
routing:
  advertise_interval: 5m
  route_ttl: 12m
  node_info_interval: 5m

connections:
  idle_threshold: 2m
  timeout: 5m
```

### High Latency Networks

For satellite or high-latency links:

```yaml
routing:
  advertise_interval: 3m
  route_ttl: 8m

connections:
  idle_threshold: 1m
  timeout: 3m
```

## Examples

### Default (Most Deployments)

```yaml
routing:
  advertise_interval: 2m
  node_info_interval: 2m
  route_ttl: 5m
  max_hops: 16
```

### Fast Convergence

```yaml
routing:
  advertise_interval: 30s
  node_info_interval: 30s
  route_ttl: 90s
  max_hops: 16
```

### Large Mesh

```yaml
routing:
  advertise_interval: 3m
  node_info_interval: 3m
  route_ttl: 8m
  max_hops: 32
```

## Environment Variables

```yaml
routing:
  advertise_interval: "${ROUTE_ADVERTISE_INTERVAL:-2m}"
  route_ttl: "${ROUTE_TTL:-5m}"
  max_hops: ${ROUTE_MAX_HOPS:-16}
```
