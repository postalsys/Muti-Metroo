# muti-metroo ping

Send ICMP echo (ping) requests through a remote agent. Test network connectivity and measure latency to any IP address via the mesh network.

**Quick examples:**
```bash
# Ping through a remote agent
muti-metroo ping abc123def456 8.8.8.8

# Continuous ping
muti-metroo ping -c 0 abc123def456 1.1.1.1

# Custom interval and timeout
muti-metroo ping -c 10 -i 500ms -t 3s abc123def456 8.8.8.8
```

## Synopsis

```bash
muti-metroo ping [flags] <target-agent-id> <destination>
```

## Arguments

- `<target-agent-id>`: The exit agent that sends the actual ICMP packets
- `<destination>`: IP address to ping (domain names are not supported)

## Flags

| Flag | Short | Default | Description |
|------|-------|---------|-------------|
| `--agent` | `-a` | `localhost:8080` | Gateway agent API address |
| `--count` | `-c` | `4` | Number of echo requests (0 = infinite) |
| `--interval` | `-i` | `1s` | Interval between requests |
| `--timeout` | `-t` | `5s` | Per-echo timeout |
| `-h, --help` | | | Show help |

## Requirements

The exit agent must have ICMP enabled in its configuration:

```yaml
icmp:
  enabled: true
  allowed_cidrs:
    - "0.0.0.0/0"  # Allow all IPv4 destinations
```

See [ICMP Configuration](/configuration/icmp) for details.

## Examples

### Basic Ping

```bash
muti-metroo ping abc123def456 8.8.8.8
```

Output:

```
PING 8.8.8.8 via abc123def456
Reply from 8.8.8.8: seq=1 time=23.4ms
Reply from 8.8.8.8: seq=2 time=21.8ms
Reply from 8.8.8.8: seq=3 time=22.1ms
Reply from 8.8.8.8: seq=4 time=24.0ms

--- 8.8.8.8 ping statistics ---
4 packets transmitted, 4 received, 0% packet loss
rtt min/avg/max = 21.8/22.8/24.0 ms
```

### Continuous Ping

Use `-c 0` for continuous ping until interrupted (Ctrl+C):

```bash
muti-metroo ping -c 0 abc123def456 8.8.8.8
```

### Custom Count and Interval

Send 10 pings with 500ms interval:

```bash
muti-metroo ping -c 10 -i 500ms abc123def456 8.8.8.8
```

### Via Different Gateway Agent

Connect through a specific gateway agent:

```bash
muti-metroo ping -a 192.168.1.10:8080 abc123def456 10.0.0.1
```

### Using Agent ID Prefix

You can use just the first few characters of the agent ID:

```bash
# These are equivalent if "abc" uniquely identifies the agent
muti-metroo ping abc 8.8.8.8
muti-metroo ping abc123def456789012345678 8.8.8.8
```

### Shorter Timeout for Fast Networks

```bash
muti-metroo ping -t 1s abc123def456 192.168.1.1
```

## Output Format

Each reply shows:
- **seq**: Sequence number of the echo request
- **time**: Round-trip time in milliseconds

The statistics summary shows:
- Packets transmitted and received
- Packet loss percentage
- RTT min/avg/max values

## Error Messages

| Error | Cause |
|-------|-------|
| `destination must be a valid IP address` | Use IP address, not domain name |
| `ICMP session failed: icmp not enabled` | Exit agent doesn't have ICMP enabled |
| `ICMP session failed: destination not allowed` | IP not in allowed_cidrs list |
| `timeout` | No reply within timeout period |

## How It Works

1. The CLI connects to the gateway agent's HTTP API via WebSocket
2. An ICMP session is established through the mesh to the exit agent
3. The exit agent sends real ICMP echo requests using unprivileged sockets
4. Replies are encrypted and relayed back through the mesh
5. All traffic between agents is E2E encrypted (transit nodes cannot see content)

## Use Cases

### Network Connectivity Testing

Verify a target network is reachable through the mesh:

```bash
muti-metroo ping exit-agent-id 10.0.0.1
```

### Latency Measurement

Measure latency to a specific destination:

```bash
muti-metroo ping -c 100 exit-agent-id 8.8.8.8
```

### Network Troubleshooting

Test connectivity to different points in a network:

```bash
# Test gateway
muti-metroo ping exit-agent 192.168.1.1

# Test internal server
muti-metroo ping exit-agent 192.168.1.100

# Test external connectivity
muti-metroo ping exit-agent 8.8.8.8
```

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success (at least one reply received) |
| 1 | Error or no replies received |

## Limitations

- **IPv4 only**: IPv6 ICMP is not currently supported
- **IP addresses only**: Domain names must be resolved beforehand
- **Exit agent requirement**: The exit agent must have ICMP enabled
