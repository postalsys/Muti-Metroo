# Exit Routing

Control where your traffic goes. An exit node opens connections to destinations on your behalf - reach internal networks, specific IP ranges, or route by domain name.

**Common scenarios:**
- Route `10.0.0.0/8` through an exit inside a corporate network
- Route `*.internal.corp` to an agent with access to internal DNS
- Route `0.0.0.0/0` for a general-purpose exit to the internet

## Route Types

- **CIDR routes**: Match destinations by IP address (e.g., `10.0.0.0/8`)
- **Domain routes**: Match destinations by domain name (e.g., `*.example.com`)

:::note SOCKS5 vs TUN Interface
Domain routes only work with **SOCKS5 clients** that send the destination hostname. The [Mutiauk TUN interface](/mutiauk) operates at Layer 3 (IP) and only sees IP addresses after DNS resolution, so it can only use **CIDR routes**. Mutiauk's autoroutes feature fetches only CIDR routes from Muti Metroo.

## Route Advertisement

Routes are propagated through the mesh:

- **Periodic**: Every `routing.advertise_interval` (default 2m)
- **On-demand**: Via HTTP API `POST /routes/advertise`

### Trigger Immediate Advertisement

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/routes/advertise
```

## DNS Resolution

DNS resolution location depends on the route type:

### CIDR Routes (DNS at Ingress)

For destinations matching CIDR routes:

1. Client connects via SOCKS5 with domain (e.g., example.com)
2. **Ingress agent** resolves domain using the system's DNS resolver
3. Ingress performs route lookup using the resolved IP address
4. Ingress opens a stream to the exit node with the **IP address**
5. Exit opens TCP connection to the destination IP

### Domain Routes (DNS at Exit)

For destinations matching domain routes:

1. Client connects via SOCKS5 with domain (e.g., api.internal.corp)
2. Ingress checks domain routes first
3. If a domain route matches, ingress opens a stream to the exit node with the **domain name**
4. **Exit agent** resolves domain using the configured DNS servers
5. Exit opens TCP connection to the resolved IP

:::tip When to Use Domain Routes
Domain routes are ideal for:
- **Split-horizon DNS**: Internal domains that resolve differently inside vs. outside the network
- **Private services**: Route `*.internal.corp` to an internal exit with access to internal DNS
- **Geo-specific resolution**: Different DNS results based on exit node location

## Route Selection

### Domain Routes

Domain routes are checked **first** for domain-based requests:

1. **Exact match**: `api.example.com` matches only `api.example.com`
2. **Wildcard match**: `*.example.com` matches single-level subdomains like `foo.example.com`
3. If no domain route matches, fall back to CIDR routing

Wildcard matching is **single-level only**:
- `*.example.com` matches `foo.example.com` and `bar.example.com`
- `*.example.com` does NOT match `a.b.example.com` or `example.com`

### CIDR Routes

Uses longest-prefix match:

1. Filter routes where CIDR contains destination IP
2. Select route with longest prefix (most specific)
3. If tied, select lowest metric (hop count)

Example:
- `1.2.3.4/32` beats `1.2.3.0/24` for 1.2.3.4
- `1.2.3.0/24` beats `0.0.0.0/0` for 1.2.3.5

## Access Control

Exit nodes only allow connections to destinations matching their advertised routes. If an exit advertises `10.0.0.0/8`, connections to any other IP range will be rejected. This provides implicit access control - you control what each exit can reach by configuring its routes.

## Verifying Routes

Check which routes are available in the mesh:

```bash
# View all routes (CIDR and domain)
curl http://localhost:8080/healthz | jq '{routes: .routes, domain_routes: .domain_routes}'

# Trigger route advertisement after config changes
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/routes/advertise
```

## Troubleshooting

### No Route to Host

```
curl: (7) Can't complete SOCKS5 connection to 10.1.2.3:443
```

**Causes:**
- No exit node advertising a route that covers the destination
- Exit node not connected to the mesh
- Route not yet propagated (wait for advertise interval)

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Check available routes
curl http://localhost:8080/healthz | jq '.routes'

# Verify peer connections
curl http://localhost:8080/healthz | jq '.peers'

# Trigger route advertisement on the exit node
curl -X POST http://exit-node:8080/routes/advertise
```

### Domain Route Not Matching

```
# Expected to use internal DNS but resolved externally
```

**Causes:**
- Using `socks5://` instead of `socks5h://` (DNS resolved locally)
- Domain pattern doesn't match (wildcards are single-level only)
- CIDR route matching before domain route (IP-based request)

**Solutions:**
- Use `socks5h://` to send hostname to the proxy
- Check wildcard pattern: `*.example.com` matches `foo.example.com` but not `a.b.example.com`
- Verify domain routes exist: `curl http://localhost:8080/healthz | jq '.domain_routes'`

### Connection Timeout

```
curl: (7) Failed to connect to destination
```

**Causes:**
- Destination unreachable from exit node's network
- Firewall blocking outbound connections
- DNS resolution failing at exit (for domain routes)

**Solutions:**
- Verify exit node can reach the destination directly
- Check exit node's DNS configuration for domain routes
- Review firewall rules on the exit node's network
